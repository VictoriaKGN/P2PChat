## Peer

Peer does not accept any argument, but it uses *rsa* and *tkinter* modules. They require `pip` to be installed, so make sure you have it installed beforehand.

To install *rsa* module, please run `pip install rsa`.\
To install *tkinter* module, please run `pip install tk`.\
Then double click `Peer.py` in file explorer or run Peer as follows:

```
python3 Peer.py
```
